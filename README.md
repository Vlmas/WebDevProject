# Final Project For The Web Development Course

During this course, we learned the basics of HTML and CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript and in particular, we studied frameworks such as Angular and Django for frontend and backend development, respectively. The course was concluded by a rather big group project, where we tried to implement the website of a large car manufacturer, Lexus.
